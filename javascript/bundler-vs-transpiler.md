__Bundler__ is a tool that puts your code and all its dependencies together in one JavaScript file. <br />
__Transpiler__ is a tool that converts your code from one language to another. <br />
Bundlers are used to bundle JavaScript modules into a single file. They are also used to bundle other assets such as CSS, images, and fonts. <br />
Transpilers are used to convert code written in one language to another. For example, Babel converts code written in ES6 to ES5 so that it can be executed in older browsers. <br />

## So, transpilers === compilers ??? Ehm, no.
A compiler is a software that converts high-level language to low-level assembly language, meanwhile a transpiler is another software, sometimes called a source-to-source compiler, which converts a high-level language to another high-level language.
