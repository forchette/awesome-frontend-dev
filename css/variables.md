**CSS Variables:**

CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties, allow you to define reusable values. You can then use these variables throughout your CSS code. They are defined with a double dash (`--`) and are accessed using the `var()` function.

**Example:**

```css
:root {
  --main-color: #06c;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--main-color);
}
```

`--main-color` is a CSS variable that is defined on the `:root` selector. The variable is then used as the value for the `background-color` property on the `body` selector.

**Pros:**

1. **Reusability**: CSS variables can be reused throughout your stylesheet. This means you can define a value once and then use it in multiple places.

2. **Maintainability**: If you need to change a value (like a color or a margin), you only need to change it in one place. This makes your CSS easier to maintain and update.

3. **Dynamic Changes**: CSS variables are processed by the browser, which means they can be updated using JavaScript. This allows for dynamic changes in your styles.

**Cons:**

1. **Browser Support**: Older browsers do not support CSS variables. However, this is becoming less of an issue as browser support is now widespread.

2. **Learning Curve**: If you're used to preprocessor variables (like those in Sass or Less), CSS variables work a bit differently and can take some time to get used to.

**Use Cases:**

CSS variables are useful in a variety of situations. Here are a few examples:

- **Theming**: You can define a set of variables for your colors, fonts, etc., and then use these variables throughout your CSS. If you want to change your theme, you only need to update the variables.

- **Responsive Design**: You can define variables for things like gutter widths or font sizes, and then update these variables in media queries for different screen sizes.

- **Component Libraries**: If you're building a component library, you can use variables to ensure consistency and provide customization options.
