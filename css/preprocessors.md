A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends the default capabilities of CSS. It allows developers to use variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and other features that make CSS more maintainable and efficient. The preprocessor takes the code written in the preprocessor's language and then compiles it into standard CSS.

## Popular CSS Preprocessors

**Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)**: Sass provides a more robust way of writing CSS. It has two syntaxes. The older is known as the indented syntax (or just "Sass") and the newer one is known as SCSS (Sassy CSS).

Example of Sass:
```scss
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```

**Less (Leaner Style Sheets)**: Less is another preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS. It's quite similar to Sass but has some differences in the way it handles things like mixins.

Example of Less:
```less
@font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
@primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% @font-stack;
  color: @primary-color;
}
```

**Why are they useful?**

1. **Variables**: You can define a value once and use it in multiple places. If you need to change that value, you only need to change it once.

2. **Nesting**: CSS preprocessors allow you to nest selectors within selectors. This makes your CSS neater and more organized.

3. **Mixins**: These are like functions for CSS. You can define a group of CSS declarations once and then reuse them throughout your site.

4. **Inheritance (Extend/Inheritance)**: This is a feature in Sass and Less that allows one selector to inherit the styles of another selector.

5. **Operators**: CSS preprocessors allow you to use mathematical operators like +, -, *, /, and %.

**Pros and Cons**

Pros:
- Increases productivity and efficiency.
- Makes managing large stylesheets easier.
- Provides advanced features like variables, mixins, and nesting.
- Improves code readability and organization.

Cons:
- Requires a compilation step, which means you need a build tool.
- Has a learning curve. You need to learn the preprocessor's syntax.
- Debugging can be harder because the line numbers in your CSS file won't match the line numbers in your preprocessor file.
- Not all features of preprocessors are supported in native CSS, which can lead to over-reliance on the preprocessor.


## Differences between Sass and Scss
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS preprocessor that allows for variables, nesting, and more. It comes in two syntaxes: the original Sass, also known as the indented syntax, and SCSS (Sassy CSS).

**Sass (Indented Syntax)**:
- Uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules.
- It's concise and uses less code.
- It doesn't use semicolons (;) or braces ({}).
- It's not fully compatible with all versions of CSS because of its unique syntax.

Example:
```scss
body
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif
  color: #333
```

**SCSS (Sassy CSS)**:
- Uses braces ({}) to denote code blocks and semicolons (;) to separate lines within a block.
- It's more verbose.
- Its syntax is similar to CSS, making it easier for those familiar with CSS to use.
- It's fully compatible with all versions of CSS.

Example:
```scss
body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
```
