## CSS Flexbox:

Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout model in CSS. It allows you to manage space distribution and alignment of items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height to best fill the available space.

**Use Cases:**

- When you want elements in a container to automatically adjust their widths and heights to fit the available space.
- For aligning items horizontally or vertically within a container.
- When the size of your elements is dynamic or unknown, like with different screen sizes.

**Pros:**

- Flexbox makes it easy to design a responsive interface and align items within a container.
- It's great for 1D layouts - either a row or a column.

**Cons:**

- It's not ideal for complex 2D layouts (rows and columns at the same time) - this is where CSS Grid shines.
- Older browsers do not fully support it.

**Example:**

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

## CSS Grid:

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you layout content within rows and columns, and has many features that make creating complex layouts straightforward.

**Use Cases:**

- When you want to create complex, two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.
- When you want to align items into a precise grid.
- When you want to create a layout that needs to respond to different screen sizes and maintain a specific structure.

**Pros:**

- It's great for 2D layouts (rows and columns).
- It gives you control over both columns and rows at once, which can simplify the HTML and CSS in complex layouts.

**Cons:**

- There's a steep learning curve to fully understand and utilize CSS Grid.
- It's not fully supported in all browsers, especially older ones.

**Example:**

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

.item {
  grid-column: span 2;
}
```

In this example, the container is a grid with 3 equal-width columns, and each item spans 2 columns.

Both Flexbox and Grid are powerful tools for creating responsive layouts. Flexbox is best for simpler, one-dimensional layouts, while Grid is best for more complex, two-dimensional layouts.
